# Transport_microbot
Curriculum Project based on micromouse design in STI. Acknowledge to Loywong in STI (providing the structure of software) and Chenglong Lian(PCB design).

## What is it about
This project is to build a tiny car(about 10cm long 5cm wide) with PCB board as its main body along with some simple 3D print supporting parts.
And we employ the RTOS from TI to smartly control this robot car. Finally we make it capable of simple cargo(Ping Pang ball) transporting.

## What it consists of
This repository includes:
1. the RTOS project (built in Code Compose Studio(CCS) from TI) --> Linemouse_KS
2. the PCB project (built in Altium Designer) --> Superminicar
3. the 3D print components (drawn in SolidWorks) -->3D
